## Artistic Treatment

### Visual Style
The film employs contrasting visual approaches to distinguish between different narrative perspectives:

- **Photographer's Camera View**: Crisp, deliberately composed shots with heightened aesthetics. Beautiful color grading with warm tones for exterior shots and cool blue tones for evening scenes.
  
- **Protagonist's Computer Screen**: A mix of found footage aesthetic and digital interface elements, creating a meta visual layer that reminds viewers they're watching recordings being reviewed.

- **Reality Scenes**: Natural lighting with handheld camera work, creating an immediate, documentary-like feeling that contrasts with the photographer's aesthetic vision.

### Color Palette
- Daytime scenes use a warm, saturated palette reminiscent of tropical Thailand
- Evening scenes utilize neon-influenced color schemes with deep blues and vibrant accents
- Computer screen interface scenes employ cooler, more desaturated tones

### Sound Design
- Minimal diegetic sound during the photographer's footage segments
- Atmospheric electronic score punctuating emotional beats
- Strategic use of silence to create tension
- The haunting cover of "Creep" serves as both commentary and emotional catalyst

### Editing Rhythm
The film employs a deliberate editing pattern:
- Longer, contemplative shots during artistic sequences
- Quick, disorienting cuts during moments of tension
- Seamless transitions between computer interface and full-screen footage

### Visual Motifs
- Reflections and glass surfaces symbolizing distortion of reality
- Framing within framing (windows, doorways, screens) emphasizing voyeurism
- Contrast between open public spaces and intimate private moments
